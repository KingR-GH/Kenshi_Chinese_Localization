Our, then, primitive ancestors would have been powerless to repel the invaders from their homelands, but instead lived at a neutral distance from them. Whether alien or simply a whole new life form to us, the level of brain power they possessed was something beyond our own physical means.\n"

So far we've learned that they are nocturnal and they prefer to take victims in the rubble of cities which have been heavily touched by death. All of its victims have disappeared without trace, we can only assume fully consumed by the wraith. A likely explanation for their existence would be a parasitic form of flesh insect, one which roots itself into the boney matter of a Shek body, and continues to grow and control the body even after its victim has perished and begun decomposition.\n"

Again, there had been signs of movement inside but after thoroughly searching the place we found no one. \n"

"However, it was when I was investigating the bar that I heard Sentinel Amphetio's scream. We looked everywhere but couldn't find him, nor could we find any sign of fighting; not even a drop of blood! It was as if that damned place itself had swallowed him. We didn't stay any longer and quickly withdrew to the outpost. \n"

"That place is cursed, the darkness has taken hold of the town, and it must have been this darkness that killed the Shek soldiers and Lusac's hound. I previously reported the presence of potential Shek scouts but I know now that the shadows were in fact wraiths. The Hub must be torn down and scorched to purify the hill and to cut off the corruption's spread!\""

"How did the skeleton survive the mass extinction of the ancients? Natural disaster and war explain the areas of destruction that we have found during excavations but they do not explain the continuation of the skeleton. Only biological and environmental factors can explain this. The ancients certainly had intellectual capacity to carry out biological warfare against each other, which the skeletons would have survived. In fact, an attack could have easily been carried out by the skeletons themselves. \n"

Prehistoric and undeveloped tribes existing in a land of such advanced science is clearly backward - are the inhabitants of the Cannibal Plains devolving? \n"
"\n"
"Without knowing whether there was an overlap in the existence of the two civilisations, we could assume that the cannibals are in fact direct descendents of the ancient inhabitants. Their degeneration could be put down to toxic environmental factors which they were unable to adapt to; damaging substances from their very own labs; induced madness from experiments gone wrong; or simply being reduced to cannibalism due to severe famine. \n"
"\n"
"However, if there was in actuality an overlap in habitation, it is highly possible that the advanced ancient inhabitants were invaded and killed by spreading or migrating cannibals. A perfect instance of survival of the fittest. Some of the weaponry and internal damages found within the labs indicate an alternate possibility of internal civil war, although the damage could be the result of simple cannibal quarrels after their occupation. The cannibals have a savage nature and are known to frequently fight amongst themselves and feed on one another, particularly given the severe lack of victims outside their tribes since the area is mainly avoided by most rational thinking individuals.\n"

"Comparing the two eras, X were considerably more advanced and established than Y, with a markedly larger network and more advanced industry. The unnatural scattering of constructions indicates a highly destructive (man-made or natural) disaster as a possible reason for downfall. The significant change in 'elaborateness' of ruins shows a heavy divide within castes. \n"
